As a student eager to learn and explore the realm of coding, I've chosen Python as my starting point. It's known for its simplicity, readability, and versatility, making it a fantastic language for someone like me who's just beginning this journey.</p>

                            Current use of AI<br/><br/>
                            AI powered assistance. AI powered assistive technology is used for many kind of services which include AI chatbots for customer service, general purpose like chatGPT and virtual shopping assistance. The AI is used to replace customer services. For example, Amazon customer service will be soon handled by chatbots to speed and help out with the process. This helps to reduce work load and speed up the time needed for consumers to receive help. Another of such use at home as a smart assistant it will help you answer questions that u ask to it some examples of it is Siri and Alexa.<br/><br/>
                            
                            These chatbots use natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms (ML). Natural language processing breaks down human speech into bits to understand what it is given by using processing techniques like Bag-of-words and tokenizations. Then machine learning algorithms then take the information and give the results the person desires. <br/><br/>
                        
                            The limitations of such algorithms are inaccurate results. Inaccurate results can include incorrect and biased results, lack of emotions and limited creativity. Due to the AI using machine learning to process a large amount of data from the internet, some results might be outdated, irrelevant or wrong. The AI chatbot can also give results which might be disturbing or insensitive to the userâ€™s feelings and have limited creativity.

                        <li><strong>Data Loading and Filtering:</strong> The code begins by importing necessary libraries and assumes that a dataframe `df` is already defined. It filters the data for the years 2019 and 2020 and specifically for the 'services' industry.</li><br/>
                
                        <li><strong>Duplicate Removal:</strong> Duplicate rows for the year 2019 are removed. This ensures that each data point is unique and contributes to a fair comparison.</li><br/>
                
                        <li><strong>Plotting:</strong> The code creates a bar plot using Matplotlib with two sets of bars, one for 2019 and another for 2020, representing retrenchment numbers in the 'services' industry. The bars are aligned at the edge of the x-axis ticks, and different widths are used to separate them visually.</li><br/>
                
                        <li><strong>Labeling and Formatting:</strong> x-axis labels are rotated by 30 degrees to prevent overlap and improve readability. Axes labels are set for both x and y axes, providing context to the reader. The plot is given a title, '2019 VS 2020', to clearly convey the purpose of the visualization.</li><br/>

                        <p>
                            <li><strong>Data Loading and Filtering:</strong> The provided Python code begins by importing the pandas and matplotlib libraries. It loads data from a CSV file hosted on GitHub using the <code>pd.read_csv</code> function, creating a DataFrame named <code>df</code>. The data is related to graduate employment surveys from various universities. The code then filters the DataFrame to extract information specifically for the year 2013 and 2019, focusing on the National University of Singapore (NUS).</li><br/>
                        </p>
                    
                        <p>
                            <li><strong>Duplicate Removal:</strong> Duplicate rows are removed from the extracted data to ensure that each entry is unique and contributes to an accurate comparison. The duplicates are removed using the <code>drop_duplicates()</code> method, ensuring the integrity of the dataset.</li><br/>
                        </p>
                    
                        <p>
                            <li><strong>Plotting:</strong> The script proceeds to create a bar plot using Matplotlib, visualizing the average basic monthly earnings for common schools of NUS in 2013 and 2019. The bars are aligned at the edge of the x-axis ticks, and different widths are employed to separate bars for the two respective years. Orange bars represent the data for 2019, while green bars represent the data for 2013.</li><br/>
                        </p>
                    
                        <p>
                            <li><strong>Labeling and Formatting:</strong> The x-axis labels, representing different schools, are rotated by 30 degrees to prevent overlap and enhance readability. Axes labels are set for both the x and y axes, providing context to the reader. However, there is a small inconsistency in labeling where the x-axis label is set to '2013' instead of the appropriate school names.</li><br/>
                        </p>
                    
                        <p>
                            <li><strong>Legend:</strong> A legend is added to the plot, differentiating between the bars corresponding to 2013 and 2019. This aids in interpreting the visualization and understanding the color-coding used in the graph.</li><br/>
                        </p>
                    
                        <p>
                            <li><strong>Visualization:</strong> The plot is displayed using <code>plt.show()</code>, allowing for a visual comparison of the average basic monthly earnings across common schools of NUS between the years 2013 and 2019.</li><br/>
