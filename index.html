                            AI powered assistance. AI powered assistive technology is used for many kind of services which include AI chatbots for customer service, general purpose like chatGPT and virtual shopping assistance. The AI is used to replace customer services. For example, Amazon customer service will be soon handled by chatbots to speed and help out with the process. This helps to reduce work load and speed up the time needed for consumers to receive help. Another of such use at home as a smart assistant it will help you answer questions that u ask to it some examples of it is Siri and Alexa.<br/><br/>
                            
                            These chatbots use natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms (ML). Natural language processing breaks down human speech into bits to understand what it is given by using processing techniques like Bag-of-words and tokenizations. Then machine learning algorithms then take the information and give the results the person desires. <br/><br/>
                        
                            The limitations of such algorithms are inaccurate results. Inaccurate results can include incorrect and biased results, lack of emotions and limited creativity. Due to the AI using machine learning to process a large amount of data from the internet, some results might be outdated, irrelevant or wrong. The AI chatbot can also give results which might be disturbing or insensitive to the userâ€™s feelings and have limited creativity.</p>

                    <p>The provided Python code is a dice rolling simulator that allows users to choose between rolling a single six-sided die or two six-sided dice. The program generates random dice rolls based on the user's choice and records the frequency of each possible outcome in a dictionary. After simulating 100 dice rolls, the code calculates and displays statistics such as the maximum and minimum occurrences, mean, and median of the dice rolls.</p>
                    <h1>Instruction:</h1>
                    <p>To use the Python code, users should run the script and input either '1' for a single six-sided die or '2' for two six-sided dice when prompted. The program then simulates 100 dice rolls based on the user's selection and provides statistics on the outcomes, including the maximum and minimum occurrences, mean, and median values.</p>

                    <h1>Concept:</h1>
                    <p>The Python code demonstrates the use of random number generation, dictionaries, loops, conditional statements, and basic arithmetic operations. It employs a function to find the key corresponding to a given value in a dictionary, sorts the outcomes, and calculates statistical measures such as mean and median. The code showcases fundamental programming concepts and statistical analysis techniques.
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Mean:</strong> Calculated by summing up all values in the dataset and dividing by the total number of values. In the code, it is computed as the total sum of dice roll outcomes divided by the number of rolls (100).</li><br/>
                      
                        <li><strong>Median:</strong> The middle value of a sorted dataset. In the code, the list of dice roll outcomes is sorted, and the median is the sum of the 51st and 52nd values in the sorted list for a total of 100 rolls.</li><br/>
                      
                        <li><strong>Maximum and Minimum:</strong> Found using the <code>max()</code> and <code>min()</code> functions, respectively. The code employs a custom function, <code>get_key_by_value</code>, to retrieve the corresponding dice face (key) for the maximum and minimum occurrences in the dictionary tracking the frequency of each outcome.</li>

                    <p>The provided Python code is an implementation of a simple console-based tic-tac-toe game. 
                        The game supports two players and a single-player mode against a computer opponent. Players take turns entering 
                        their moves by specifying the row (a, b, or c) and column (1, 2, or 3) where they want to place their symbol ('X' 
                        for player 1 and 'O' for player 2 or the computer). The game checks for a winner or a draw after each move and 
                        displays the current state of the board.</p>
                    <h1>Instruction:</h1>
                    <p>To play the game, run the Python script and input the number of players (1 or 2) when prompted. 
                        In a two-player game, each player takes turns entering their moves. In a single-player game, the player competes 
                        against a computer opponent that makes random moves. The game ends when one player wins, it's a draw, or all 
                        available moves are exhausted. The board is displayed after each move, and the winner or draw is announced at 
                        the end.</p>

                    <h1>Concept:</h1>
                    <p>The code implements a classic tic-tac-toe game using Python. It utilizes a 3x3 grid represented by 
                        variables for each cell. The check function is responsible for verifying if a player has won by checking all 
                        possible winning combinations. The game loop continues until there is a winner or a draw, and the display function 
                        is used to print the current state of the board. In single-player mode, the computer opponent makes random moves 
                        by selecting available positions from a list. The game employs basic input/output interactions and conditional 
                        statements to control the flow of the game.</p>

It loads data from a CSV file hosted on GitHub using the <code>pd.read_csv</code> function, creating a DataFrame named <code>df</code>. The data is related to graduate employment surveys from various universities. The code then filters the DataFrame to extract information specifically for the year 2013 and 2019, focusing on the National University of Singapore (NUS).</li><br/>
                        
                            <li><strong>Duplicate Removal:</strong> Duplicate rows are removed from the extracted data to ensure that each entry is unique and contributes to an accurate comparison. The duplicates are removed using the <code>drop_duplicates()</code> method, ensuring the integrity of the dataset.</li><br/>
                        
                            <li><strong>Plotting:</strong> The script proceeds to create a bar plot using Matplotlib, visualizing the average basic monthly earnings for common schools of NUS in 2013 and 2019. The bars are aligned at the edge of the x-axis ticks, and different widths are employed to separate bars for the two respective years. Orange bars represent the data for 2019, while green bars represent the data for 2013.</li><br/>
                       
                            <li><strong>Labeling and Formatting:</strong> The x-axis labels, representing different schools, are rotated by 30 degrees to prevent overlap and enhance readability. Axes labels are set for both the x and y axes, providing context to the reader. However, there is a small inconsistency in labeling where the x-axis label is set to '2013' instead of the appropriate school names.</li><br/>
                        
                            <li><strong>Legend:</strong> A legend is added to the plot, differentiating between the bars corresponding to 2013 and 2019. This aids in interpreting the visualization and understanding the color-coding used in the graph.</li><br/>
                        
                            <li><strong>Visualization:</strong> The plot is displayed using <code>plt.show()</code>, allowing for a visual comparison of the average basic monthly earnings across common schools of NUS between the years 2013 and 2019.</li><br/>
